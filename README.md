### 🧠 About Me

- Former founder/operator of two ops-heavy companies, scaled to $300K+/month using custom scraping and automation tools.
- Now focused full-time on backend engineering and machine learning — building predictive systems and RL agents on custom-built infrastructure (500+ CPUs, 100+ GPUs).
- Passionate about autonomous decision systems, real-time OSINT pipelines, and reinforcement learning for real-world simulations.
