### My Background

- Former founder/operator of two ops-heavy companies, scaled to $300K+/month using custom scraping and automation tools.
- Now focused full-time on backend engineering and machine learning — building predictive systems and RL agents on custom-built infrastructure (500+ CPUs, 100+ GPUs).
- Passionate about autonomous decision systems, real-time OSINT pipelines, and reinforcement learning for real-world simulations.

### What I Am Working On

#### MailAgent.AI — AI Marketing Agent
- Built FastAPI backend to generate and send GPT-4 cold emails using scraped and enriched business data.
- Integrated multi-account rotation, reply tracking, lead scoring with Redis, Celery, and PostgreSQL.

#### OpenHouse.AI — Real Estate Data Agent
- Scrapes property listings across MLS sites using dynamic filters and selectors.
- Exposes enriched real estate data via authenticated REST API endpoints with rate limiting.

#### Project Archon — Multi-Agent RL Simulation Engine
- Backend engine simulating governance decision-making with multi-agent reinforcement learning.
- Modular agent architecture with custom reward functions and outcome visualization.

#### Project Echo — Ideological Drift Classifier
- Ingests and clusters social content using OpenAI embeddings to model ideological trajectories over time.
- Prepares data for downstream RL agent training on belief shift simulation.

#### GradFlow — Gradient Descent Visualizer
- Uses NumPy + Matplotlib to animate optimization paths on convex surfaces.
- Demonstrates effects of learning rate and momentum in training loops.
